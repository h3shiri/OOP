====================================
Building a SpaceWars game and creating various types of SpaceShip.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
I have implemented numerous types of ships in seperate classes.
In addition, supplemented the factory method for loading all the ships.

==================
=  Design:  =
==================
I have one abstract class which is the SpaceShip, all the other various ships are extensions.
So they inhert the basic structure from SpaceShip, while the key difference between the ships is within
the doAction method.
In addition, I designed the drunkard movement to be quite random with tendency to shot and spin too much.
I have allowed the SpecialSpaceShip to hack the game rules slightly, using its mind control abillities 
it can terminate any ship which gets too close to it.

=============================
=  List of submitted files: =
