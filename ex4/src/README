Building an AVL tree from scratch.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
I have designed the basic node structure class (TreeLink) for the tree and the implemented the AVL.
The AVL contains all the automatic balancing methods.
In addition, I have attempted to stick close as possible to the given minimal API.

=============
=  Design:  =
=============
I have firstly build the TreeLink (aka a node) it's a basic link that holds internal data
(value and height) and 2 pointers one for the left son and one for the right one.
Except that that all the fields are private and could only be accessed few getters and setters.

In the AVL the add method firstly preform a binary search (which takes at most the tree's height) until
it locates the appropriate place for the new element it then balance the tree recursively at each
node along the path from the root to the current insertion location.
The delete method works slightly differently, it traces the target value in the same manner
(binnery search). After we have located the relevent value we replace it by the minimal value in the
right subTree and balnce the nodes from the buttom (aka the minimum element we found) all the way back
to the initial deletion location. I have implemted both bineary searches in a recursive manner
add uses (recursiveAdd) where delete uses (recursiveDelete) its mportant to note these functions
behave differntly and the recursiveDelete method has significantly different end cases.
Only then we update the global fields in the given AVL, its also important to note that path tracing
and balancing occurs within the recursive calls.
