=================
I have designed a Firectory processor that can use a variety of filters and order mechanisms
to sort and return the requaested files in a given directory. The filters package cotains all the
filters implemintations and appropriate errors. Similarly the orders package cotains all the various 
order implementations. Note the exceptions follow an hierarchical structure divided to appropriate
sub-groups.
