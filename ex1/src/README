= README for ex1 the Nim game =
====================================
Building a Nim game and creating a competition between various players.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
We have implemented 3 seperated classes, one for each object.
Competition is the main driver, manages the rounds between the players and
keeps scores.
==================
=  Design:  =
==================
We have allowed few extra data members in order to kepp tracks
of all the parameters in the Competion, such as players's scores, last player..etc
Except that I have implemented all the public classes acording to the API.
Moreover, in the Smart player I have chosen to focus on the case of only one non-empty
line. Then if possible we preform a winning move accordingly, otherwise we attempt
to single out a connected componnent.

=============================
=  List of submitted files: =
=============================

README - this file.
Competition.java - the central manager of the competition.
Board.java - the board class, has all the internal methods of interacting with it.
Move.java - a basic class for a single move on the board.
Player.java - contains all the various player and their strategies.

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
Extra comments are inside the classes in order to make to code readability
better to the naked eye.
